# burger

**Overview**

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) in the MVC design pattern; The app used Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate HTML.
